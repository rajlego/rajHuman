HOW TO deal with procrastinating:

# description of a program that serves the goal above
# todo: add questions from sivv thing
get notebook and go through following questions
How would someone successful complete the goal? How would I feel if I donâ€™t do the required task? What is the next immediate step I need to do? If I could do one thing to achieve the goal on time, what would it be?
