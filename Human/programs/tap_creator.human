HOW TO create good TAPs

get a notebook
Identify an Action you want to do.
Find a concrete sensory Trigger for the situation you want to do the action in EX: “The feeling of the coarse rope that opens my curtains in the morning.”
Describe the Action you’d like to perform, in detail. Be specific about the action you’d like to. EX: “Pick up my jogging shoes and walk outside the door to begin jogging.”
Put the Trigger and Action in a “When [Trigger], then [Action]” loop. EX: “When [I feel the rough coarseness of my curtain rope,] then [I’ll go grab my jogging shoes and open the front door].”
Write the TAP down somewhere you can find it again. EX: Having a digital or physical “TAPs List” document can be a very strong way to make it easy to review which habits you’re currently training. If you end up forgetting the cue or action, then it’s obvious you won’t be able to practice the behavior.
Mentally rehearse the TAP at least 5 times. EX: Actually take the several minutes to do some visualizations—going over it in your mind helps you recognize the Triggers when they show up in the real world.
